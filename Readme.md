Mapty

## Introduction

Mapty is a web application designed to track and visualize running and cycling workouts on an interactive map. This project was created as a personal exercise to improve skills in web development and geospatial data handling.

## Features

- **Interactive Map:** Utilizes a map interface to pinpoint workout locations.
- **Workout Input:** A sidebar provides input fields for recording workout details, including:
  - Workout type (Running or Cycling)
  - Duration
  - Distance
  - Elevation gain (for Running) or Cadence (for Cycling)
- **Dynamic Calculations:** Automatically calculates and displays relevant workout metrics upon input.
- **Marker Visualization:** Displays workout locations on the map with informative markers.
- **Date Tracking:** Records the month and day of each workout.
- **Multiple Workout Entries:** Supports the entry and display of multiple workouts.
- **Smooth Navigation:** Clicking on a workout entry in the sidebar or a marker on the map smoothly scrolls the map to the corresponding location.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures optimal viewing experience across various screen sizes.

## Usage

1.  **Location Permission:** Upon opening the application, your browser will likely display a pop-up window asking for permission to access your location. **Please allow location access for Mapty to function correctly.** The application relies on your location to display the map and record workout positions.
2.  **Data Persistence:** The workout data you enter is stored locally in your browser and will remain even if you refresh the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R). This allows you to continue where you left off without losing your entries.
3.  **Map Interaction:** Click on the map to add a new workout location.
4.  **Sidebar Input:** Fill in the workout details in the sidebar.
5.  **Workout Type:** Select either "Running" or "Cycling" to customize input fields.
6.  **Data Entry:** Enter the duration, distance, and either elevation gain (Running) or cadence (Cycling).
7.  **Submit:** Press Enter to record the workout.
8.  **Visualization:** View the workout on the map with a marker and in the sidebar.
9.  **Navigation:** Click on a marker or sidebar entry to navigate to the workout location on the map.

## Responsive Design

The application is designed to be responsive across various screen sizes, including:

- **1200px (Large Desktops)**
- **992px (Desktops/Laptops)**
- **768px (Tablets)**
- **576px (Mobile Phones)**
